# My Next Version of my site

Current Version (V.5): <https://thadaw.com> (Gatsby)

## Philosophy
- Using React & TypeScript
- Static site generators
- lowest dependecies as much as possible
- lightweight
- using `markdown` is enough. no need `MDX`

## My Next version trial

- Hugo theme with [mildronize.github.io (next branch)](https://github.com/mildronize/mildronize.github.io/tree/next)
- Hugo theme [hugo-theme-mild](https://github.com/mildronize/hugo-theme-mild) using webpack5 to render CSS and JS.

## Good Example with MD & MDX Blogging
